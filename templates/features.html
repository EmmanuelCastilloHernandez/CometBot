  <p style="font-family:verdana">The bot itself is packed with features to keep people engaged in using the bot for longer periods of time.<br>Here is some of the things Comet offers:</p>
  <div id="niceSubHeader">Super Snipe and Image Snipe</div>
  <p2>Comet supports the ability to save three deleted messages at any given moment. This ability is called <span class="niceNumberArt">Super Snipe</span>. To access this feature you do <span class="niceNumberArt">#SuperSnipe (1-3)</span> on a server where comet is available.<br><br>Image snipe is also a feature of Comet, where the bot is able to snipe images with the regular <span class="niceNumberArt">#snipe</span> command that only stores the most recently-deleted message. To make Image Snipe be more private, the images get deleted once the bot restart of after 120 seconds have passed. This 120-second timer also applies for Super Snipe.<br></p2>

  <div id="niceSubHeader">Edit Snipe</div>
  <p3>Comet supports the ability to display a message's content prior to when it was edited. This is called <span class="niceNumberArt">Edit Snipe</span>. To use Edit Snipe, you user the command <span class="niceNumberArt">#edit</span> to display a message before and after it was edited. Note that <span class="niceNumberArt">Edit Snipe</span> clears after 80 seconds have gone by.<br></p3>

  <div id="niceSubHeader">TTS with 1200-Character Limit</div>
  <p4>Comet supports text-to-speech in any voice channel thanks to <span class="niceNumberArt">gTTS</span>. Due to this, Comet also has the ability to speak the text inputted in different languages. These languages are English, Spanish, Tagalog (Filipino), Armenian, Korean, Russian, and many more shown in the screenshot below.<br>To use TTS, you run <span class="niceNumberArt">#tts (text to speak)</span> on a server where comet is available. The bot will then prompt the user to choose their language and the bot will shortly speak the text inputted in that language. Note that long pieces of text will take longer to process.<br></p4>

  <div id="niceSubHeader">Zalgo Generation</div>
  <p5><br>To put it simply, you can make text that looks like the taste of s̸͙͗p̸̛̘a̴͔͝r̴̻͑k̶͉̏ḽ̴̀ǐ̴̱n̷̬͑g̴̨̋ ̵͚̀w̴͎̿a̷̛̗t̶̞̄ẹ̵̈́r̸͎̅  in Comet.<br>To do this run <span class="niceNumberArt">#zalgo (text to curse)</span> in a Comet-enabled server and Comet will generate the text in a message.</p5>
  <br/>
  <div id="niceSubHeader">Music Player</div>
  <p6><br>The bot itself tries to play music to the best of its ability. Use #play to play music from YouTube, #ql to check the queue, #remove to remove a song from the queue, #q to queue a song, #pause to pause the player, #skip to skip the current song, and #leave to make Comet leave the Voice Channel. Supports Spotify Song Links.<br></p6>
