# Comet ToS:
Thank you for being interested in using Comet for your Discord needs. Before proceeding, read this Terms of Service, which covers how data is handled and what happens when the bot is misused.

## **SECTION 0**:
### Our Stance on Human Rights and Hate
Comet and the development team ACTIVELY CONDEMN sexism, racism, anti-semitism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, crimes against humanity, and crimes against the vurnerable in societies like children.

Using Comet to spread hatred or incite harm will never BE allowed under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES and can result in users or entire servers being blacklisted from ever using the bot after an offense has occured. This will all depend on how severe the offense was.

## **SECTION 1**:
### Usage of Data
#### Comet Economy:
Comet never stores any user names, only the User IDs (which are publicly accesible) which the bot translates into user names when the economy commands are used.

#### CometCRISIS:
What happens in a CometCRISIS use stays private. Do note an email for archive purposes is sent to my email, but the info in the email is the same as the SOS signal; the format being:
> Time Sent IN Pacific Standard

> User

> Level of Severity

> Type of Crisis

#### Image Snipe:
Comet NEVER STORES any images deleted by a user EVER. The images are all stored in variables that get wiped either after 120-seconds or when the bot's Repl restarts.

## Section 2:
### Misuse:

#### Dev Team Liability and Reporting Misuse
The Comet Dev Team DOES NOT take responsibility for obscene photos or content sniped by any of the Snipe commands. However, if misuse occurs, report the misuse to eta_c4rinae#7810 and report the user misusing snipe to Discord or a server's admins if such user is using Snipe for malicious reasons like breaking Discord TOS rules and/or distributing illegal content like ch!ld p0rnography. 

To Report illegal content, use `#crisis` in a DM with comet and choose the `Abuse` section, where you can report the content to the FBI. Also contact your local police department about illegal content.

#### CometVoice Misuse
Using CometVOICE services, such as the Comet Music Player and Comet TTS (#play, #tts) for malicious reasons (distribution of illegal material, harrasment, bullying) is strictly forbidden. Please behave when using it since we don't want to feel forced to remove CometVOICE due to too many people not knowing how to use the service appropiately.

#### CometCRISIS Misuse
Misusing CometCRISIS can result in you being banned from not only using the service, but also the bot as a whole if the misuse was severe. Misuse can be classified as purposefully using the "Contact Developer" function for a use that's not an emergency, an emergency being a situation where one can result injured or dead if not dealt with.

Misusing CometCRISIS unintentionally will land in a warn and repeated offenses will result in a ban.
